Notes to me/anyone else:

If `make` doesn't work, you may need to re./configure
For instance, ./configure CXX='clang++'
Also note that the STO version of thttpd only works with
the poll() system calls (not select(), kqueue(), etc.)

To run thttpd:
sudo ./thttpd -h 127.0.0.1
To run in the foreground:
sudo ./thttpd -D -h 127.0.0.1

You can test it by going to http://127.0.0.1
or by running something like `ab -n1000 -c100 http://127.0.0.1/` (1000 requests, 100 at a time)
