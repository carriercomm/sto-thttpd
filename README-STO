Notes to me/anyone else:

You may need to run ./configure again (I ran it on OS X).
Then just run `make`

To run thttpd:
sudo ./thttpd -h 127.0.0.1
To run in the foreground:
sudo ./thttpd -D -h 127.0.0.1

You can test it by going to http://127.0.0.1
or by running something like `ab -n1000 -c100 http://127.0.0.1` (1000 requests, 100 at a time)
